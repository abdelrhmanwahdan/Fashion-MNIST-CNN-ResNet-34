# Fashion MNIST CNN ResNet 34
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Fashion MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using convolutional neural network (CNN) by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. using the famous convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet 34 to achieve high accuracy.
